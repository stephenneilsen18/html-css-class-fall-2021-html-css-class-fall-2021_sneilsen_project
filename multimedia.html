               <p>Video and motion graphics are quickly becoming the most prevalent method used to describe an event, process, or argument. The proliferation of video has been unprecidented over the last decade and few mediums hold equivalent economic value. The sustained consumption of video information has created an expectation among users for sophisticated depictions through motion, animation, and narration only possible through video. Further, static graphics, animation, and other traditional visual tools can be incorporated to produce an indespensable tool of persuasion.</p>

                    Motion-based visuals, especially those with dynamic user control and interactivity, are the persuasion tools of the present and future. I have a passion for such projects and have produced, edited, and directed several animation sequences and video projects. When used in court to educate, my clients have achieved remarkable outcomes. 
                    
                    Most of my interactive displays and video productions remain confidential and cannot be shared. However, this project is a representation of motion design used to educate a judge on patented diagnostic technology infringed on by several competitors.</div>

                Galderma patented an injectable, bioresorbable dermal implant used to treat cosmetic imperfections, and alleged MedInter’s Derma Veil product infringed.

                    The project sample above is a clip from a series of videos designed to educate school administrative staff worldwide on the Montessori approach to education. Because thousands of educators rely on these videos to pass their coursework to become certified administrators, visual displays of the information presented are critical to maintaining user engagement and to define each subsection of the instruction that acts as a reference guide for users while scrubbing through content.
