                    <p><b>Depictions Trump Descriptions</b><br>Digital media has transformed how we interpret and exchange information. It is ubiquitous and people everywhere constantly navigate visual interfaces to search for and extract meaningful content. More than ever, depictions trump descriptions, and visual displays of information become the most valuable tool in the communicatorsâ€™ tool box.<br><br>
                    <b>What I do</b><br>I am an expert in forging highly effective tools that inform and persuade decision-makers.  Most often I craft them from complex data sets or from highly technical descriptions of things. I can take it all apart or put it all together so anyone can understand. And most importantly, I give ideas power through expressive narrative storytelling.<br><br>My methods are proven through high-stakes litigation where the ability to convince is the difference between tens of millions of dollars or years in prison. My work has been validated through focus groups, research summits, and the results in courtrooms with judges, juries, arbitrators, and expert panels speak for themselves. </p>
